## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="gug.jpg">

Hello! I am a computational linguist from Western Massachusetts, USA. I recently graduated from the [EM-LCT](https://lct-master.org/) program, where I spent my first year at the University of Groningen (ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±) and my second year at the the University of the Basque Country (ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸). I wrote my Master's thesis about the utility of multilingual word embeddings in transfer learning, supervised by Eneko Agirre and Gertjan van Noord. In January 2019, I will start a PhD project at Uppsala University (ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª), where I will focus on multilingual Universal Dependency parsing under supervision of Joakim Nivre. 

## Research Interests

In general, I am interested in all things concerning cross-lingual, multi-task, and transfer learning - especially when applied to low-resource languages and scenarios. I am also into multilingual word and sentence representations (embeddings). On occasion, I dabble in computational sociolinguistics.
