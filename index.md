## about

<img class="profile-picture" src="eastside.jpg">

I am a first-year PhD student in computational linguistics at Uppsala University (ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª), supervised by Joakim Nivre and Anders SÃ¸gaard. My research interests include multilingual NLP, latent syntax, linguistic typology, and interpretability. Before my PhD, I graduated from the [EM-LCT](https://lct-master.org/) program, where I spent my first year at the University of Groningen (ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±) and my second year at the the University of the Basque Country (ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸). I grew up in Western Massachusetts (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸).

<!-- Hello! I am a computational linguist from Western Massachusetts, USA. I'm currently a first-year PhD student at Uppsala University (ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª), where I focus on multilingual morphosyntatic parsing under the supervision of Joakim Nivre. Before starting my PhD, I graduated from the [EM-LCT](https://lct-master.org/) program, where I spent my first year at the University of Groningen (ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±) and my second year at the the University of the Basque Country (ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸). I wrote my Master's thesis about the utility of multilingual word embeddings in transfer learning, supervised by Eneko Agirre and Gertjan van Noord. -->

<!-- ## research Interests -->

<!-- In general, I am interested in all things concerning cross-lingual, multi-task, and transfer learning - especially when applied to low-resource languages and scenarios. I am also into multilingual word and sentence representations (embeddings, I guess). On occasion, I dabble in computational sociolinguistics.  -->
