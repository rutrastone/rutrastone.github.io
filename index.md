## about

<img class="profile-picture" src="eastside_red.jpg">

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at KU Leuven (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª), working within the LAGoM-NLP group led by Miryam de Lhoneux. My research concerns Multilingual NLP, where I investigate methods for making language representation fair and equitable. In particular, I am interested in how principled data selection and language sampling can be employed as part of the pre-training process, so that models can learn from _better_ data --- rather than simply more of it. In addition, I am also interested in how typological bias is reflected in commonly employed evaluation datasets and metrics, and how this affects our appraisal of multilingual models.

Prior KU Leuven, I earned my PhD in computational linguistics at Uppsala University (ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª), supervised by Joakim Nivre and Anders SÃ¸gaard. My dissertation focused on the syntactic knowledge encoded by language models, investigated through the lens of dependency parsing (available [here](https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1784732&dswid=-4818)). Before my PhD, I graduated from the [EM-LCT](https://lct-master.org/) program, where I spent my first year at the University of Groningen (ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±) and my second year at the the University of the Basque Country (ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸). I grew up in Western Massachusetts (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸).
