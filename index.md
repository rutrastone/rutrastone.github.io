## about

<img class="profile-picture" src="eastside_red.jpg">

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at UC Louvain (Belgium), working within CENTAL (Centre de Traitement automatique du Langage) under supervision of Marie-Catherine de Marneffe. My current research focuses on _explainability_ in the face of _label variation_, as elicited in both humans and LLMs. 

Prior to my current appointment, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at KU Leuven (Belgium), working within the LAGoM-NLP group led by Miryam de Lhoneux. There, I co-led a large-scale audit of Wikipedia as an NLP resource and developed the [texieve](https://github.com/akulmizev/texieve) Multilingual NLP toolkit. 

Before that, I earned my PhD in computational linguistics at Uppsala University (Sweden), supervised by Joakim Nivre and Anders Søgaard. My dissertation focused on the syntactic knowledge encoded by language models, investigated through the lens of dependency parsing (available [here](https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1784732&dswid=-4818)). 

Before my PhD, I completed the [Erasmus Mundus Language and Communication Technology](https://lct-master.org/) program, spending my first year at the University of Groningen (Netherlands) and my second at the the University of the Basque Country (Spain). 

I am from Western Massachusetts, USA. 

<!-- My research concerns Multilingual NLP, where I investigate methods for making language representation fair and equitable. In particular, I am interested in how principled data selection and language sampling can be employed as part of the pre-training process, so that models can learn from _better_ data --- rather than simply more of it. In addition, I am also interested in how typological bias is reflected in commonly employed evaluation datasets and metrics, and how this affects our appraisal of multilingual models. -->
